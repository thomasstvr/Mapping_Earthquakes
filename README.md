# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a world map with overlays of all the earthquakes within the last 7 days. The map has a separate overlay to show only major earthquakes (greater than 4.5) as well as fault lines. The map has three different styles as well (Street, Satellite and Dark).

## Results 
The map shows all (or only major) earthquakes for the last 7 days, as reported by https://earthquake.usgs.gov/. The markers showing the location of the earthquake are scaled and colored by magnitude. A popup containing magnitude and location of each quake is accessed by click on each marker.
