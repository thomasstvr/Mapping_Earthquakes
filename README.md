# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a world map with overlays of earthquakes within the last 7 days, updated in real time. The map employs GeoJSON data which is retrieved using JavaScript, the D3 and Leaflet libraries which is then plotted on a mapbox map through an API request. Below, you can see the different layers and filters included with the map.

Here, you can see the initial map as it is loaded into a browser. It uses the ‘Streets’ view layer and includes all earthquakes as well as fault lines. Earthquakes are shown as dots which vary in size and color based on magnitude.

This is the map shown with the ‘Dark’ layer selected. As you can see, there is a selection box at the top right of the map.

Lastly, we have the ‘Satellite’ layer.

This is what the map looks like with the ‘Streets’ layer selected as well as major earthquakes.
